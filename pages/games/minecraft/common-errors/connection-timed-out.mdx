# Connection timed out

If you are experiencing high ping or getting timed out while playing a game, it could be due to one of the following reasons:

1. The game server (or proxy, e.g. BungeeCord/Velocity) has insufficient resources to handle the amount of players.
2. There is an outage/issue with our network - you can check out our monitoring [here](https://status.berrybyte.net/).
3. The proxy (e.g. BungeeCord/Velocity) is misconfigured (only applies if you have one).
4. There is a problem with your [ISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider) - this is the case most of the time.

## Remedy

* Double-check your proxy's configuration, if you have one.
* See if anybody else experiences these issues on your server, if not, it's most likely a problem with your connection.
* Increase the [paper.playerconnection.keepalive](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/reference/system-properties#paperplayerconnectionkeepalive) timeout property (Paper only).
