# Connection Timed-out

If you are experiencing high ping or getting timed out while playing a game, it could be due to one of the following reasons:

   1. The game server is experiencing performance issues.
   2. There is an outage/issue with our network. - We monitor our network 24/7 to ensure availability.
   3. The proxy (such as Waterfall or Velocity) is misconfigured.
   4. There is a problem with your ISP (Internet Service Provider) - Majority of the time, this is the case.

To troubleshoot these issues, try using Cloudflare Warp and see if that resolved your issue. If not, send an MTR report to our [Discord community server](https://berrybyte.net/discord) or a [ticket](https://berrybyte.net/ticket)
