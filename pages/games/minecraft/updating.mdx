# Updating your Minecraft server

Updating your server software (Paper/Spigot/Forge/etc.) is a very simple process. There are two ways to go about this.

## Manual update

1. Download the latest version of the server software you are using from the respective websites:
    * [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/downloads)
    * [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools)
    * [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/)
2. Stop your server and create a backup, just in case the update fails.
3. Delete the old server software jar file (usually named `server.jar`, double check your startup flags to make sure).
4. Place the new jar file in the same directory as the old one. Ensure the name of the jar is the same, if it has changed, make sure the startup flags reflect the change. 
5. Start your server, and run `/version` or `/about` to ensure the server is running the new version.

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

    If you're a BerryByte customer, you can alternatively copy the download URL from the download page from the websites, and paste it into the **Download From URL** button in the File Manager. This will download the jar automatically and place it in the working directory. Refer to [this guide](../../lime/importing-files#download-files-from-url) for more information.

## Automatic update (Lime)

1. Stop your server.
2. Create a backup, just in case the update fails. You can do this by clicking the "Create Backup" button in the Backups tab.
3. Head to the Minecraft tab and ensure the version is set to `Latest`.
4. click the "Reinstall" button. This button overwrites the server.jar file with the latest version of the server software you are using.
5. Start your server, and run `/version` or `/about` to ensure the server is running the new version.
