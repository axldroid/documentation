# Installing modpacks for your Minecraft server

While our team is in the process of developing a modpack manager solution to be integrated into the panel, we'll have to stick with a manual installation for now.

## General steps
To install a modpack, you will need to identify the required Forge version specified in the modpack's readme file or on the modpack's webpage.
In the **Minecraft** tab, input the version number (e.g. `1.16.5-36.2.39`) and press "Reinstall" in the **Settings** tab to download the necessary Forge version.

Next, delete all files except for your modpack and select "Reinstall" again. Start the server at least once, then unpack the modpack's .zip file. Finally, restart the server to complete the modpack installation process.


If the .zip of the modpack opens a folder, head into that folder and select all the files. Then, press the "Archive" button and move the archived file into the main directory. This can be done by pressing the "Move" button and adding a `../` behind the name of the file (e.g `../archive-2023-01-08T021140Z.tar.gz`). This will move the file one directory up. Then, press the "Unarchive" button, that will extract the files into the main directory.
