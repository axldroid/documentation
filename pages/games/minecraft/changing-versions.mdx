# Changing versions

Changing the version of your Minecraft server is a fairly simple process which involves 4 steps.

1. Take a backup of your server, just in case something goes wrong. Makes life much easier in the long run.
2. Stop your server.
3. In the "Minecraft" tab, change the `Version` variable to the version you want to use.
4. In the "Settings" tab, press **Reinstall** to start the update process.
5. Start your server and run the `/version` command to check that the version has changed.

And voil√†, you're done! You can now enjoy your new version of Minecraft.
