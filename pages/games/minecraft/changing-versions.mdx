# Changing versions of your Minecraft server

Changing the version is a fairly simple process which involves 4 steps.

    1. Take a backup of your server, just in case something goes wrong. Makes life much easier in the long run.
    2. Stop your server.
    3. In the **Minecraft** tab, change the `Version` variable to the version you want to use.
    4. In the **Settings** tab, press `Reinstall` to start the update process.
    5. Start your server and run the `/version` command to check that the version has changed.

And voila, you're done! You can now enjoy your new version of Minecraft. If you have any issues, please contact us on Discord or via a support ticket.
