# Changing versions

Changing the version of your Minecraft server is a fairly simple process which involves 4 steps.

1. Take a backup of your server, just in case something goes wrong. Makes life much easier in the long run.
2. Stop your server.
3. In the "Minecraft" tab, change the `Version` variable to the version you want to use.
4. In the "Settings" tab, press **Reinstall** to start the update process.
5. Start your server and run the `/version` command to check that the version has changed.

### What Java version do I need for each version in Minecraft?

You may encounter a Java error in the console when updating a new version, this could mean that you have an incompatible Java version. To fix this, you can update your Java version or change the `Java Version` variable in the **Settings** tab to the appropriate version:

    * Java 8: Minecraft 1.8+
    * Java 11: Minecraft 1.16+
    * Java 16: Minecraft 1.17+
    * Java 17: Minecraft 1.19+



And voil√†, you're done! You can now enjoy your new version of Minecraft.
