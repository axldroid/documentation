# Getting started

Welcome to the BerryByte documentation website.

This site contains useful guides & tips on how to run various types of game servers (including Rust, Minecraft and more to come), as well as running VPSes.<br/>
This guide is built for BerryByte users, however the same guides can be applied in other environments.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    This documentation is a work-in-progress. There may be errors or typos in the guides, however we're constantly working to improve them.
</Callout>

## Contributing

We always welcome new users, who would like to contribute to this knowledge base to make it an extensive directory of guides for server owners and administrators. Head to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/berrybyte-net/documentation#contributing) for instructions to contribute.
