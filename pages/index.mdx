# Getting Started
 
Welcome to the BerryByte documentation website. This site contains useful guides & tips on how to run various types of Game Servers (including Rust, Minecraft, and more to come!), as well as running Virtual Servers (VPS). This guide is built for BerryByte users, however the same guides can be replicated on other systems.

## Contributing
We are always welcome for users who would like to contribute into building this documentation and knowledgebase to an extensive directory for server owners and administrators. Head to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/berrybyte-net/docs) for instructions to contribute.
