# Importing Files
We've included and built in several ways to upload your server's files or folders into the panel including SFTP, web upload, server importer function, and download from URL.

## Web upload
To directly upload a files to the panel, you can head to the **File Manager** tab, and drag-n-drop the files to the screen.

If you're wanting to upload a folder to the panel, you may encounter a `Failed to get multipart form data from request`. You will need to archive the folder using a tool like [7Zip](https://7zip.org), or [WinRAR](https://winrar.org) and upload it that way. Once uploaded, you can press the three-dots and press the **Unarchive** button.

This method of upload is limited to **100MB**.

## Server Import tool
On the panel, we've built in a tool to import your server's files from another host or server directly into the panel. This tool is located in the **File Manager** tab, and is the **Import Files** button. This tool will allow you to import your server's files into the panel. Refer to the gif below for a visual example.

There, you can fill in the fields with the details of the SFTP/FTP/FTPS credentials from your old host. Normally, the base directory can be left as default for most users, unless you only want to import a specific folder. For example, if you're only wanting to import the plugins folder, you would fill the field as `/plugins` and will disregard all other files except for that specific folder.

 Once you've filled in the fields, you can press the **Import Files** button. This will import all of your server's files, like your server's configuration files, such as the `server.properties` file, and your server's plugins, and worlds.

## Importing via SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)

SFTP is a secure way to transfer files from your computer to the panel. This is a great way to upload your server's files to the panel, and is the recommended way to upload your server's files especially if the files are stored on your computer, or if the files are larger than 100MB.

1. Download a SFTP client such as [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) (Recommended), or [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org).
2. Once installed, head to the **Settings** tab, and press the **Launch SFTP** button.
3. You will be prompted with a window to enter your SFTP password, it will be the same password used to login to the control panel
4. Locate the files/folder on your computer, and drag-n-drop them into the SFTP window. This will upload the files to the panel and a rough ETA will be displayed normally on the bottom of the screen.

## Download files from URL

You can also download files from a URL directly into the panel. This is a great way to download a plugin or a resource pack from a website, and upload it directly into the panel, and be a very simple method to download a server jar file from a website, and upload it directly into the panel.

1. Head to the **File Manager** tab, and press the **Download from URL** button.
2. You will be prompted with a window to enter the URL of the file you want to download. You can also enter the name of the file you want to download, and the location you want to download it to.
3. Once you've filled in the fields, you can press the **Download** button. This will download the file from the URL, and upload it to the panel.
